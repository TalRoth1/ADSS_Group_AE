Important note: The project was compiled with java 21, so it needs to run on a machine with java 21 or higher.

To start the system, double-click the jar file, a command line window should open.
As soon as the system starts, there should appear a menu with all the available options:
1. Add Supplier
2. Add Agreement
3. Change Agreement
4. Remove Agreement
5. Get Supplied Items
6. Get Cataloged Items
7. Create Order
8. Get Order Details
9. Change Order
10. Cancel Order
11. Get Order History
12. Load Data
13. Exit

To choose an option, simply input the corresponding number in the terminal. For example,
if we want to add a supplier, we will input 1 in the terminal.

Some functions require initial data to exist, if you want dummy data for testing use the Load Data function (option 12).
If an option requires further information from the user, for example Get Order requires the order ID,
it will ask for the required data one field at a time. Some fields with more complicated formats like order date
specify the required format, for example a date format is YYYY-MM-DD.

Every time an option is chosen the options menu will reappear waiting for the next request.
When you are done using the system, either choose option 13 to exit or simple close the terminal.
